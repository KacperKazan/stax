# Claude Code Integration

Install the stax skill file so Claude Code can operate stax workflows correctly.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/stax.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesarferreira/stax/main/skills.md
```

This enables workflow assistance for stacked branch creation, submit flows, and related operations.

For Codex setup, see [Codex Integration](codex.md). For Gemini setup, see [Gemini CLI Integration](gemini-cli.md). For OpenCode setup, see [OpenCode Integration](opencode.md).
